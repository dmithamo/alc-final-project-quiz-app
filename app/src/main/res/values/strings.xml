    <string name="qn_2">Question 2</string>
    <string name="qn_2_text">In the wake of early advances in AI in the 1950s, Allan Turing
        developed a  test to tell \'intelligent\' computer systems and human beings apart.

    <string name="soln_2_d">D.  Deep Blue </string>

    <string name="qn_3">Question 3</string>
    <string name="qn_3_text">A computer was considered to have passed the above test if: </string>
    <string name="soln_3_a">A.  A judge was convinced the computer imitated the human
        being with an accuracy of at least 65%</string>
    <string name="soln_3_b">B.  The computer performed equally as well as or better than
        the average human player in the traditional Chinese game of Go</string>
    <string name="soln_3_c">C.  A person receiving information from both the computer and a human being
        was unable to differentiate between the two sources on the
        basis of that information alone</string>
    <string name="soln_3_d">D.  A human being judged that the computer system could fool human
        beings into believing it was sentient
        (i.e., could feel, perceive, experience subjectively)</string>

    <string name="qn_4">Question 4</string>

    <string name="qn_6">Question 6</string>
    <string name="qn_6_text">Some of the following terms refer to types of hacking
        techniques than an attacker might use. [And some don\'t]. Which one does AND
        is correctly matched with its description?</string>
    <string name="soln_6_a">A.  Keylogger : attacker directs a computer system to record input from
        the keyboard into a log file, including entered passwords and logins. He then studies the
        log file for logins into a target system</string>
    <string name="soln_6_b">B.  Bait and Switch : an attacker fakes a popularly visited site, and sends
        a link to the fake site to an unsuspecting user. The attacker can the steal any
        data the user enters at this trojan site</string>
    <string name="soln_6_c">C.  Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) : an attacker infects a computer
        system with malware that alters the legitimate access credentials to that
        computer system, thereby denying legitimate users of the system access to it.</string>
    <string name="soln_6_d">D.  All the above refer to hacking techniques, and are
        correctly matched with their definitions</string>

        and why?</string>
    <string name="soln_7_a">A.  Apple iOs ; because it employs industry recommended Pre-Relay
        Isolated Storage and Serialization techniques, which store all user data only on the device,
        and must encrypt and serialize all user data BEFORE it is
        backed up in their servers</string>
    <string name="soln_7_b">B.  Microsoft Windows Mobile OS ; because it is the least adopted
        mobile system of these three</string>
    <string name="soln_7_c">C.  Android ; because it has a larger user base, and
        therefore benefits from a vast research base</string>

        is incorrectly matched with its description?</string>
    <string name="soln_8_a">A.  White Hat Hacker : also called ethical hacker, hacks into computer
        systems to identify vulnerabilities in the system in order to sensitize the systems\'s
        owners of such vulnerabilities</string>
    <string name="soln_8_b">B.  Black Hat Hacker : exploits vulnerabilities in computer systems
